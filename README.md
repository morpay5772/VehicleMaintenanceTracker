# Project Name: Vehicle Tracker

## Project Description
Vehicle Tracker is a console based C# application developed to manage a collection of vehicles. The application allows users to add, delete, update, and view vehicles. It uses an SQLite database for data storage and demonstrates core object oriented programming concepts that include inheritance, composition, polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces, constructors, and access specifiers. 

## Project Tasks
- **Task 1: Set up development environment**
    - Install VS Code
    - Confiure Git and GitHub repository
- **Task 2: Plan the project**
    - Define the project purpose
- **Task 3: Implement core features**
    - Develop the main functionalities of the application
    - Write clean and efficient code
- **Task 4: Test the application**
    - Run the application
    - Debug and fix issues
- **Task 5: Document the project**
    - Create a comprehensive README file
- **Task 6: Finalize and submit**
    - Review and refine the project
    - Submit the final version on GitHub

## Project Skills Learned
- Implementing interfaces and abstract classes
- Using inheritance and polymorphism in class hierarchies
- Managing composition with object references (e.g., ParkingLot holding Vehicles)
- Accessing and modifying SQLite databases using ADO.NET
- Structuring modular and maintainable C# code
- Reading and writing data to persistent storage
- Console I/O and basic user interaction
- Code documentation and class-level summaries

## Language Used
- **C#**: Primary programming language
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for storing vehicle and maintenance data

## Development Process Used
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Full application design is based on OOP principles

## Notes
- Ensure the database file is not locked or corrupted; delete and recreate if you experience malformed errors.
- The application is meant for educational use and as a portfolio example to demonstrate software engineering skills.
